# Computer Organization
This is the final project of this course. This final project is required to design 3 types of CPUs by Verilog.
These 3 types of CPUs are: Single Cycle Implementation, Pipelined Implementation, and Datapath with Hazard Detection.

## Single Cycle Implementation
### Description:
The characteristic of a single-cycle implementation is that each instruction is fully executed before the next instruction begins.
