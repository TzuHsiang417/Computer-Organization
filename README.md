# Computer Organization
This is the final project of this course. This final project is required to design 3 types of CPUs by Verilog.
These 3 types of CPUs are: Single Cycle Implementation, Pipelined Implementation, and Datapath with Hazard Detection.

## Single Cycle Implementation
### Description:
The characteristic of a single-cycle implementation is that each instruction is fully executed before the next instruction begins.

## Pipelined Implementation
## Description:
Pipeline implementation differs from single-cycle implementation by dividing the CPU into 5 stages. In each stage, pipeline registers are introduced to store values passed down from the previous stage. As a result, in pipeline implementation, multiple instructions can be executed simultaneously.
